Source code for "Spring Batch in Action" book, Manning edition.

Installation instructions:
 * install Java Development Kit 1.6 (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
 * with Maven
   - install Maven 3 (http://maven.apache.org)
   - in the root directory of the project, run "mvn clean install" (without the

   Maven repository.

   - install the source as Maven projects (e.g. with SpringSource Tool Suite, File > Import > Maven > Existing
   Maven Projects and select the root directory of the project).
